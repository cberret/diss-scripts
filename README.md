# Dissertation Scripts

I use these scripts to convert my dissertation to various other formats, to automatically archive backups, and to track my progress.

If you would like to use these scripts yourself, you can get started by inserting the information for your local machine and servers to the "config_blank.sh" file and saving it as "config.sh".

If you would like to know exactly what the script is doing, run "compile_chapters_manual.sh" instead. 

If you want to run these files on a cron job, or if you don't like reading feedback while a script runs, "compile_chapters_auto.sh" is more appropriate.
